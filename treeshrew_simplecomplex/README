This is the analysis directory for the tree shrew laminar profile project

Work on these files originally began in 

TOOLS/VH_matlab_code/FitzLabTools/simplecomplex
     this directory contains both analysis files for the physiology as well as
     files for a model that steve was messing around with


Raw data files are on KFC at Z:\data\treeshrew_transLGNctx\


To get started one can plot

prefix = 'Z:\data\treeshrew_transLGNctx\';
expernames = {'2008-05-22','2008-05-30','2008-06-05','2008-06-18','2008-06-25','2008-07-10','2008-07-23','2008-08-07','2008-08-14','2008-08-20','2008-09-25','2008-10-14','2008-10-22'};

[cells,cellnames] = doplotsimplecomplexori5(prefix, expernames);



% how do we look at the cells that are in 2008-05-30? for example?

ds = dirstruct([prefix expernames{3}]);
[cells,cellnames] = load2celllist(getexperimentfile(ds),'cell*','-mat');

A = findassociate(cells{125},'','','')

 % how can I list all of the associates for a given cell?

{A.type}'


 % direction index used in nature paper, varies between 0 and 1

'SP F0 Ach OT Fit Direction index blr'

B = findassociate(cells{125},'SP F0 Ach SF Response curve','','')

B.data is (first row is spatial frequencies we tested, 2nd row is mean response, 3rd row is standard deivation, 4th row is standard error)

    'SP F0 Ach SF Response curve'  % whole response curve  hint:  myerrorbar(B.data(1,:),B.data(2,:),B.data(4,;),B.data(4,:))
    'SP F0 Ach SF Pref'   % the SF with the highest response
    'SP F0 Ach SF Low'  % this is the low SF cut off
    'SP F0 Ach SF High' % this is the high SF cut off
    'SP F0 Ach SF sig resp p'  % this is the P value on whether the differences of responses across SFs are significant or not
    'SP F0 Ach SF sig resp'  % this is 0/1 based on whether the P value is 0.05 or less
    'SP F0 Ach SF visual response p'  % this is the P value of whether the differences across all responses including blank are significant
    'SP F0 Ach SF visual response'
    'SP F0 Ach SF DOG Pref'  % this is a difference of gaussian fit, which is generally lousy
    'SP F0 Ach SF DOG Low'
    'SP F0 Ach SF DOG High'
    'SP F0 Ach SF DOG R2'
    'SP F0 Ach SF DOG Fit'


 % how can I find which cells have some data

for i=1:length(cells), if ~isempty(findassociate(cells{i},'SP F0 Ach SF Response curve','','')), i, end; end;
