# vhlab_publishedstudies
Code for data analysis and figure generation from specific VH lab projects and collaborations

This code is available but, by in large, is poorly documented and difficult to read by anyone other than the author.
Perhaps by making it public it will motivate us to document it better, particularly as the code is re-used in later studies.

Indeed, it would be remarkable if anyone other than the authors can understand this without weeks of effort.
